# Water-rocket-simulator

To do:
ok 1. In c++
ok 2. GUI in Qt
ok 3. Plots from Qt
ok 4. Read document
6. Simulate what type of trajectory? Vertical would be best.
7. Input 1) sizes, pressure, mass of water, Volume of bottle 2) sizes, pressure, volume,  - models mass of water and outputs plot X axis - mass of water, Y axis - height
Mass of empty rocket, Drag factor, Nozle impedance
8. Everything from usable units to SI
9. Saving project
10. Mathematical/physical model and algorithm 
ok 11. Test Qt, input and output with plot --- PRIO
